# Liquid Salon DAO

---

## What is a DAO?

A DAO is an internet-native entity with no central management which are regulated by a set of automatically enforceable rules on a public blockchain, and whose goal is to take on a life of its own and incentivize people to achieve a shared common mission. Liquid Salon is a blockchain-native protocol so a DAO is inevitable!

## Why DAO?

DAO is about maximizing stakeholder value. The users and contributors are also the owners. While community ownership seems weird and novel and almost hippie, it’s actually a more natural model than a company. The reason Liquid Salon DAO does it is that it is too hard to coordinate having a lot of stakeholders who all get a say in decision making. Besides, there are a few benefits of DAOs over traditional structures: Full transparency, Minimal startup costs, Censorship resistance, Borderless, Incorruptible organisational processes, Easier to raise capital.

## Responsibilities of DAO
